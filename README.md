Code base for my xiao Esp32 BLE robot.  If you also use an ESP32 Xiao by SEEED studio, just copy and paste this code with the correct libraries downloaded.

Notes:  Use Esp32 servo by Kevin Harrington to control the ESC.  **VERSION OF THE LIBRARY MUST BE 3.0.7 OR EARLIER, NOT LATER**.
        
        
        Use bluepad32 libaries by ricardo quesada for the bluetooth.

        ESP32 Xiao can only use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which means that an Xbox controller is required and is **NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PLAYSTATION OR NINTENDO SWITCH**.  Maybe smartphones, but good luck with that
